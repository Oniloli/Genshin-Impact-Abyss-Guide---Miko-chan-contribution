        <p>2 red rectangles will appear where your feet is and each rectangle will
          spawn 2 earthquakes which will always go the opposite direction the your
          character is facing.
          <br />
          <br />The total duration of the 2 earthquakes travelling is 4 seconds. Once
          they disappear the 2nd red rectangle will appear and spawn 2 more earthquakes.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You can just avoid the damage by dashing out of the way before the waves
          hit you.</p>

        <p>if you don&apos;t pay attention to the earthquakes they can hit you when
          you&apos;re off-guard. They are harder to see with aimed-shot characters
          because zoom in while in aimed mode.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you are unable to avoid the damage consistently you can use a shield,
          use your burst or switch to another character to keep your important characters
          from taking the damage.</p>

        <p>It is possible to <b>iframe</b> dash through an earthquake and not take
          any damage.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>However you <b>cannot iframe</b> through both earthquakes because your dash
          doesn&apos;t travel far enough to dodge both of them. You&apos;ll not take
          damage on one but that dash will head straight for the 2nd one so it&apos;s
          best to dash to the side of the earthquake and move out of range of the
          2nd one.</p>
