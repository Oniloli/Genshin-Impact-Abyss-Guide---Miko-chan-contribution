        <p>The Electro Triangle will appear in front of the character in the direction
          they are facing. It acts as a roadblock to get in your way.</p>
        <p>&#x200B;</p>
        <p>Be sure to watch your surroundings so you don&apos;t get caught off-guard
          in an awkward position when it spawns.</p>

        <p>The Triangle does 8 ticks every second for 5 seconds. The electro damage
          will also cause your character attacks to be interrupted.</p>

        <p>Your character can very quickly die if you fight around the triangle and
          accidentally touch it. So try to move away from where the triangle is to
          avoid sticky situations.</p>
